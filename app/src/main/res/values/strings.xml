                The Guesthouse Hotel was originally built in 2008 as
                boutique condominiums, but soon found its groove as a place
                for 10 unique—and spacious—vacation rentals. \n\nIn 2013,
                The Guesthouse broke ground on a new building next door,
                adding 15 more deluxe units, and a lobby, club room, retail
                space, business center, and gym, to fully develop into an
                all-accommodating boutique hotel.
